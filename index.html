        <p>Broadly speaking (read: overgeneralizing), anything you make for an employer belongs to them, not you. You cannot copy things you did for your job without commiting copyright infringement.</p>

          <li>MIT (A permissive license)</li>
          <li>The GNU General Public License or GPL (A FREE AS IN FREEDOM copyleft license)</li>

        <h2>What is a patent?</h2>
        <p>Under United States law, a patent is a right granted to the inventor of a (1) process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, (2) that is new, useful, and non-obvious. A patent is the right to exclude others from using a new technology.</p>

        <h2>What Apache says about Patents</h2>
        <pre><code style="font-size: 14px" class="nohighlight">3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.</code><code style="font-size: 14px" class="fragment nohighlight">If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</code></pre>

        <h2>Come on already and tell us about React</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">React was first released in 2013 under the Apache license.</li>
          <li class="fragment">In October 2014, they switched to the 3-clause BSD license (for copyrights) and added a separate PATENTS file with a custom written patent grant (which they tweaked a bit in April 2015).</li>
          <li class="fragment">This combination of licenses is often called "Facebook BSD+Patents"</li>
        </ul>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What did it say?</h2>
        <pre><code style="font-size: 14px" class="nohighlight">The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent
Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate
affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or
in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of
its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating
to the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its
subsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent
infringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a
patent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is
unrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate
under section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.</code></pre>

      <section>
        <h2>Wait, I thought this had a happy ending?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="fragment">It's possible that the MIT License can implicitly grant patent rights, but this seems shaky and unproven.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Many people who have looked at Facebook's portfolio say there aren't patents in React, but it's hard to be 100% sure.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Bottom line: Using React is *probably* OK, but I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.</li>
